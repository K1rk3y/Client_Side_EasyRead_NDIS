Your data will be deidentified and Intelife will not receive any information that will be able to identify you. Intelife will not have access to individual responses, only an aggregated report. An organisational report will only be provided if there are 20 or more responses to the survey. The aggregated report will also only provide demographic group breakdowns in the report where there are more than 10 responses in that group. It will therefore not be possible for individual workers to be identified from any responses that they may give. When will we find out the results of the survey? We are aiming to communicate overall results by the end of March 2024. The People at Work survey is part of a psychosocial risk assessment process. This will help Intelife identify factors that may cause harm to workers psychological health and safety. No, the system does not provide workers with a personal report.

Please talk to Alistair, the Health Safety Advisor, on 0861 691 1139 or email him on alistairpintelife.org Can I get a copy of my responses? Some of the demographic questions collected at the beginning of the survey are mandatory to complete. However, if you feel uncomfortable you can select the prefer not to say answer. All other questions are optional, but we strongly encourage you to answer as many questions as you can to enable us to get an accurate picture of psychological health in the workplace. Appendix 3 PAW Survey Frequently Asked Questions The survey should take around 18 minutes to complete. What are the demographic questions used for? Psychosocial hazards have always been considered under health and safety, particularly in the context of Lone Workers, FIFODIDO staff, small teams in remote areas and workers who may be in particularly stressful roles. These questions allow Intelife to examine differences in psychological health and safety across different areas and groups across the organisation. These breakdowns will only be provided if there is a minimum of 10 responses for each group in order to protect your privacy. What will the survey responses be used for? Are the survey questions mandatory? What is the People at Work survey? The new legal framework around the Work Health and Safety Act 2020 requires that Psychosocial hazards are specifically identified with measures put in place to prevent hazards causing harm to employees. The People at Work survey is a key part of this risk assessment and hazard mitigation process to ensure that Intelife workers are protected, in accordance with the new legislation, from psychological as well as the more traditional physical hazards which may be present in the workplace.
